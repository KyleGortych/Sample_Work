              The fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small crepuscular fox native 
              to the Sahara Desert and the Sinai Peninsula. Its most 
              distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to 
              dissipate heat. The fennec is the smallest canid species. Its 
              coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to the desert 
              environment with high temperatures and little water. Also, its 
              hearing is sensitive to hear prey moving underground. It mainly 
              eats insects, small mammals, and birds. The fennec has a life 
              span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the 
              wild. Its main predators are the Verreaux's eagle-owl, jackals, 
              and other large mammals. Fennec families dig out burrows in the 
              sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as 
              120 m2 (1,292 sq ft) and adjoin the burrows of other families. 
              Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from 
              the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the fennec is 
              currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social 
              interactions is limited to information gathered from captive 
              animals. The fennec is usually assigned to the genus Vulpes; 
              however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec 
              and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by indigenous 
              peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, it is 
              considered an exotic pet.

              The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama]) 
              (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely 
              used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the 
              Pre-Columbian era.
            </p>
            <p>
              Llamas are very social animals and live with others as a herd. 
              Their wool is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas can learn 
              simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they 
              can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km 
              (5–8 miles). The name llama (in the past also spelled "lama" or 
              "glama") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ancestors of Llamas are thought to have originated from the 
              central plains of North America about 40 million years ago, and 
              subsequently migrated to South America about three million 
              years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of 
              the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were 
              extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven 
              million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to 
              importation from South America in the late 20th century, there 
              are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United 
              States and Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Aymara mythology llamas are important beings. The Heavenly 
              Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it 
              rains. According to Aymara eschatology llamas will return to 
              the water springs and lagoons where they come from at the end 
              of time.

              The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canine 
              of South America. Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it 
              is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the 
              genus Chrysocyon (meaning "golden dog").
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the largest canid in South America, with a weight between 
              20 and 30 kg, and reaches up to 90 cm at the withers. Its long, 
              thin legs and dense reddish coat give it an unmistakable 
              appearance. The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous 
              animal adapted to the open environments of the South American 
              savanna, with an important role in the seed dispersal of 
              fruits, especially the wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum). The 
              maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by 
              scent marking, but also gives a loud call known as 
              "roar-barking".
            </p>
            <p>
              This mammal is found in open and semi open habitats, especially 
              grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of 
              south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; 
              northern Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, 
              and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very 
              rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through 
              loss of habitat. The International Union for Conservation of 
              Nature lists it as near threatened, while it is considered a 
              vulnerable species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment 
              and Renewable Natural Resources.

            <p>
              Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of 
              the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). 
              The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, 
              Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found 
              in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, 
              all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size 
              from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin 
              species are also known.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their 
              skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. They 
              live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. 
              Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants 
              and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They 
              tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a 
              litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about 
              two years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and 
              scales, which are used in Chinese traditional medicine) and 
              heavy deforestation of their natural habitats and are the most 
              trafficked mammals in the world. As of January 2020, there are 
              eight species of pangolin whose conservation status is listed 
              in the threatened tier. Three (Manis culionensis, M. 
              pentadactyla and M. javanica) are critically endangered, three 
              (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia 
              gigantea) are endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and 
              Smutsia temminckii) are vulnerable on the Red List of 
              Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation 
              of Nature.

            <p>
              The pygmy marmoset, genus Cebuella, is a small genus of New 
              World monkey native to rainforests of the western Amazon Basin 
              in South America. It is notable for being the smallest monkey 
              and one of the smallest primates in the world, at just over 100 
              grams (3.5 oz). It is generally found in evergreen and river-
              edge forests and is a gum-feeding specialist, or a gummivore.
            </p>
            <p>
              About 83% of the pygmy marmoset population lives in stable 
              troops of two to nine individuals, including a dominant male, a 
              breeding female, and up to four successive litters of 
              offspring. The modal size of a standard stable troop would be 
              six individuals. Although most groups consist of family members
              , some may also include one or two additional adult members. 
              Members of the group communicate using a complex system 
              including vocal, chemical, and visual signals. Three main 
              calling signals depend on the distance the call needs to travel.
              These monkeys may also make visual displays when threatened or 
              to show dominance. Chemical signaling using secretions from 
              glands on the chest and genital area allow the female to 
              indicate to the male when she is able to reproduce. The female 
              gives birth to twins twice a year and the parental care is 
              shared between the group.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pygmy marmoset has been viewed as somewhat different from 
              typical marmosets, most of which are classified in the genera 
              Callithrix and Mico, and thus is accorded its own genus, 
              Cebuella, within the family Callitrichidae. The biggest threats 
              are habitat loss and the pet trade.

            <p>
              The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a mammal species native to 
              the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It is listed as 
              Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is 
              estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and continues 
              to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and 
              inbreeding depression. Despite its name, it is not closely 
              related to the giant panda.
            </p>
            <p>
              The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a 
              waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the 
              size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body, and is 
              somewhat heavier. It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo, 
              but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary 
              animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely 
              sedentary during the day. It is also called the lesser panda, 
              the red bearcat, and the red cat-bear.
            </p>
            <p>
              The red panda is the only living member of the genus Ailurus 
              and the family Ailuridae. It has previously been placed in the 
              raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic 
              analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic 
              classification in its own family, Ailuridae, which is part of 
              the superfamily Musteloidea, along with the weasel, raccoon and 
              skunk families. Traditionally it was thought to consist of two 
              subspecies. However, results of genetic analysis indicate that 
              there are probably two distinct red panda species, the Chinese 
              red panda, and the Himalayan red panda, which genetically 
              diverged 0.22 million years ago.
